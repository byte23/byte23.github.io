description:
    For Siemens and Pago facil.
    Analysis and development of distributed point of sale platform with high security standards. 
    We used PCs distributed in different locations on the city. The user can go to any POS and make the payment for services (gas, electricity, phone, etc.), transfer money, etc. 
    That information was encrypted/verified and sent to our payment gateway.
